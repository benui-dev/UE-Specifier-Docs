      A `BlueprintPure` function is shown as a node with no execution pin. By
      default functions marked `const` will be exposed as pure functions. To make a const function not a pure function, use `BlueprintPure=false`.
      
      Pure functions do not cache their results, so be careful when doing any non-trivial amount of work a blueprint pure function. It is good practice to avoid outputting array properties in blueprint pure functions.

      Causes a `UFUNCTION` with _no parameters_ and _no return value_ to be shown in the details panel of object instances.
      
      Could be useful for adding helper functions to change the values on the selected instance. For example increasing the level of an enemy by changing their stats, or filling out default values using C++. 
  
      To reiterate, only works with functions that have no parameters, and return `void`. `BlueprintCallable` is not required. Only works on instances of the class. So Actors placed in a level, *not* on Blueprint classes.
  
      This works as a flag in the main position, or as a boolean in the meta position. I would stick to the Main position just because there are more examples of this in the Unreal codebase.

      Unreal has an in-game cheat console, accessed with the tilde key by default. It's great for adding debug commands and cheats. Any `UFUNCTION` marked with `Exec` can be executed there and provided with parameters.
  
      The classes that are supported by `Exec` by default are:
      * `UWorld`
      * `UPlayerInput`
      * `UGameInstance`
      * `APlayerController`
      * `APawn`

      Without `AutoCreateRefTerm`, a reference paramter requires that the user provide it with a value, which can be annoying for parameters that have a sensible default.
      When a blueprint is compiled where those parameters are not supplied with a value, an error like this will be shown \"The current value of the \'Color\' pin is invalid\: \'Color\' in action \'Some Color Without Ref\' must have an input wired into it (\"by ref\" params expect a valid input to operate on).\"
  
      Note that it's possible to set multiple ref parameters by using a comma-separated list.

      Not sure how to describe this one. Technically it doesn't have a name. Use it to give a parameter a default value, and override any existing C++ default value. See the examples and screenshots for how it affects what is displayed in-editor.

        UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, meta=(Number="99"))
        void DefaultParamInMeta(int32 Number);

        void DefaultParamInCPP(int32 Number = 99);
  
        UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, meta=(Number="1"))
        void DefaultParamInBoth(int32 Number = 99);
