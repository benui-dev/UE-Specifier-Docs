      \"Defaults\" in this context means that this property will be visible in Blueprint classes (e.g. the `BP_Cat` asset in your content browser), but not instances (e.g. `Cat` in your map).
  
      You might want to make a property VisibleDefaultsOnly if it is defined and used in C++, but Blueprint users may want to see the value of it when editing the Blueprint asset itself. It is effectively a way of making a property visible but read-only.
  
      Note that this refers to being visible in the __Details__ panel, not visible through the Blueprint Graph. For that you need to use `BlueprintReadOnly`.

      This property will only be visible in Blueprint instances, like those that exist in the map.
  
      This is a more rarely-used visibility specifier, but you could maybe use it for showing Blueprint users the values of properties that are defined in C++ or are calculated based on other properties.

      You might want to make a property `EditInstanceOnly` if it does not make sense to have a default value in the Blueprint asset. For example a `ATrigger` actor could point to `ADoor` instances within a map and tell them to open when the trigger is activated. In this example it would not make sense to have `TArray<ADoor*>` be editable within the Blueprint asset, so you could use `EditInstanceOnly`.

      There are two different ways of limiting which instanced structs can be chosen in the editor:
      
      a) Use FInstancedStruct and set the BaseStruct meta property to point to structure.

      Using `Category`, it's possible to group properties together into expandable folders. The pipe character `|` can be used to create sub-folders. For example `Category="Character Info|Health"` would create two folders\: `Character Info`, and within that, `Health`.
  
      The categories are also used when searching for properties within the Blueprint graph, if they are exposed with `BlueprintReadOnly` or `BlueprintReadWrite`.
  
      Note that whitespace is important; if there are two properties one marked with `Category="Parent|Child"` and one with `Category="Parent | Child"`, it will result in two folders being displayed.

      `EditCondition` can be used to change a property from read-only to writeable depending on another property.
  
      The simplest way is simply using another `bool` property, but as of 4.23 more complex statements are supported.

      It is worth noting that `EditCondition` also changes the appearance of properties inside Blueprint logic Make Struct nodes.

      You can use this to limit the depth to which nested properties are shown. It might be useful if you have structs within structs within structs to an extreme degree.
      
      No examples of this in the source code as far as I can tell.

      This hides the little return arrow that is shown to reset a value back to the value defined in the parent Blueprint or C++ class.
  
      This can be especially useful for large structs or arrays, where you would want to avoid people being able to accidentally wipe the entire contents.

      `ClampMax` and `ClampMin` force numbers entered into the property to be clamped within the specified range.
  
      In comparison, `UIMax` and `UIMin` stop the number from going outside the bounds when the user drags their mouse, but still allows them to type in a number outside the `UIMin`/`UIMax` range.

    comment: |
      Generates a dropdown instead of a text box for the `FName`/`FString`/`TArray<FString>`/`TArray<FString>`/`TMap` with an `FName` or `FString` property. The contents of the dropdown are populated by the results of the function.
  
      For specifying options for Keys or Values within a `TMap`, look at `GetKeyOptions` and `GetValueOptions`.
  
      The function is called once on opening the Blueprint in the editor, and then every time the user clicks the drop-down.
  
      Note the documentation mentions to always return `TArray<FString>` even if the property is `FName`. But it seems to work even if you return `TArray<FName>`. Examples in the engine codebase return `const TArray<FString>&` rather than just plain `TArray<FString>` but either seems to work.
  
      The function that returns the array of options *must* be a `UFUNCTION()` or it will not work. The editor searches through the hierarchy of owning objects for the `UPROPERTY()`, using the first `UFUNCTION` it finds with a matching names. This means that `USTRUCT`s can use functions defined in owning `UObject`s, where `USTRUCT`s would not normally be able to contain `UFUNCTION`S  

      `GetOptions` also supports external static function references via `Module.Class.Function` syntax. If the function name contains a `.`, it is assumed to be static and the editor will crash if it is not.

      text: TArray FuncName() const; // Always return string array even if FName property.

      When displaying an array of structs, `TitleProperty` allows you to customize a text that is used in the right-hand column to summarize each entry in the array. The title can be built from any of the struct properties that have `GetName()`. So any `FString`, `FName`, `float`, `int32`, `FGameplayTag` properties would usable as a title for array elements.
  
      As of Unreal 5.0, you can use `FText::Format`-like formatting to output multiple parts of structs in the array. See the `FDogMapping` example below.
    documentation:
      text: Used by arrays of structs. Indicates a single property inside of the struct that should be used as a title summary when the array entry is collapsed.

      `BlueprintReadOnly` and its sibling `BlueprintReadWrite` allow Blueprints to access C++-defined variables. `BlueprintReadOnly` variables can be read/used in Blueprint graphs but their values cannot be changed.
  
      By default, variables marked with `BlueprintReadOnly` or `BlueprintReadWrite` cannot be `private` (i.e. they must be `protected` or `public`). However the [`AllowPrivateAccess`](#allowprivateaccess) meta flag can change this to allow `private` variables.
  
      It seems possible to mark a property with both `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintGetter`, though I assume that only the Getter is called and the `BlueprintReadOnly` is redundant.

      The `UFUNCTION` used by `BlueprintGetter` must be a pure function marked with `const` and `BlueprintGetter` (or technically `BlueprintPure` seems to work too). 
  
      If you end up with an error message like `error: use of undeclared identifier 'Mode'`
  
      Make sure your property and functions do not have clashing names. You cannot call your property `bIsPasswordEnabled` and the getter function `bool IsPasswordEnabled() const`

      The same thing works if your property name ends with "Event", but the metadata is preferred.

      Marking a property with `DeprecatedProperty` and `DeprecationMessage` causes a warning to be shown when compiling a Blueprint that uses the variable.
  
      It seems that without `DeprecationMessage`, there is no warning shown. So make sure you add one.
  
      In the Unreal codebase I've seen a lot of instances of renaming the variable with a prefix `DEPRECATED_` and using `DisplayName` to make it look the same to Blueprints.

      As of 5.5-ish, marking a Blueprint visible property as deprecated shows a warning unless you define a `BlueprintGetter`.

      When using `SpawnActor` or `Construct Object` from Blueprints, marking a property with `ExposeOnSpawn` will cause it to be shown in the same node. Useful for variables you often want to set up when creating an Actor or Object.
  
      You must mark `ExposeOnSpawn` properties as either `BlueprintReadOnly` or `BlueprintReadWrite`. It doesn't seem to matter which for the purposes of `ExposeOnSpawn`. If you add `ExposeOnSpawn` without `BlueprintReadOnly` or `BlueprintReadWrite`, the UBT shows an error mentioning `BlueprintVisible` but I guess this is a generic term for both `BlueprintReadOnly` and `BlueprintReadWrite`.
  
      Some editor code that uses this meta flag checks for non-null string, some checks for `\"true\"` for truthiness. Some examples in the codebase use it like a flag, others like a bool. I would recommend to treat it like a bool.

      Allows C++ code to access `UWidget` variables defined in `UUserWidget` Blueprint. If that makes no sense, [check out this tutorial](https://benui.ca/unreal/ui-bindwidget/)
  
      Technically what happens is widgets within the UserWidget Blueprint's widget tree are bound to matching `UPROPERTY(meta=(BindWidget))` variables. See `UWidgetBlueprintGeneratedClass::InitializeBindingsStatic` for the gory details.

    comment: When a `BindWidget`-specified widget is not found, an error is thrown on compilation. When a `BindWidgetOptional`-specified widget is not found, only an information-level log entry is displayed. Use it for widgets that your User Widget does not require to work. Note you will need to use `nullptr` checks to see if the widget exists in the Blueprint.

      When importing data to fill out a data table, by default all columns are required to exist in the CSV file. If an column does not exist in the CSV, an error is shown (see screenshot).

      By marking a property with UPROPERTY(meta=(DataTableImportOptional)), it is not required that a column exist in CSVs with that name.

      It can be useful if a property is deprecated.

      - |

      The only time this is actually used is inside the Lyra Example Project but has existed in the engine prior to Unreal Engine 5.0.
    
      To confirm that it exists within the engine you can look inside `PrimaryAssetIdCustomization.cpp` and look for `GetMetaData("AllowedTypes")`, 
      that file was added in 4.16(but the underlying code for it could have existed somewhere else in an earlier version).
    
      For some reason this doesn't even show up in the `ObjectMacros.h` file.
